# REact State Homework

## Overview

In this homework, you will be finishing the migration of a React from using the Context API to using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) package instead. This builds off of code written in Unit 22, which you'll have in your Solutions folder at some point.

Please take some time to read about Redux, and also read the fact sheet I provided. It's important that you know what Redux does.

For this assignment, follow the TODO items in these files:

* _client/src/App.js_
* _client/src/utils/reducers.js_
* _client/src/pages/Detail.js_
